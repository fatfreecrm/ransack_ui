# Ransack UI

Provides HTML templates and JavaScript to build a fully functional
advanced search form using Ransack.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'ransack_ui'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ransack_ui

## Usage

Make your model ransackable (if you name associations, it will enable you to search them aswell).

```ruby
has_ransackable_associations %w(account tags)
ransack_can_autocomplete
```

In your controller, where you'd like to add search functionality, add the following before_filter hook. You can change the 'index' action if needed.

```ruby
before_filter :load_ransack_search, :only => :index
```

Insert the following helper call into your rails view code where you'd like the search form to appear.

```ruby
= ransack_ui_search
```

Now you can start playing with the results.
